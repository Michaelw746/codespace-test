    <h1>The Problem</h1>
    <p> 
        The unployment rate is 3.7% as of Nov 2022, and the black and hispanic community are dispotionally affected, with an unemployment rate of 8.6%. <br>
        The latest economics down trend and inflation escalated this issue and affect black and hispanic communities harder than others.<br>
        Watts is a neighborhood that has a population of mostly black and Hispanics family.
        Hispanics makes up about 74 percent of the watts community and African American makes up about 22 percent of watts community.<br>
        

        <br>
        "I have time and energy but I don't know where to find a job." - A typical jobless person in a community said.<br>
        "I need someone help with the posters but I don't know where to find them." - A coomunity officer said so, looking for some labor.<br>
         That is the real problem - information gap in community<br>
